# Rider Editor Tool
This S&box tool adds editor options for opening the S&box solution in Rider.

## Usage
On the top menu bar there is a new tab named Rider. Within that choose your Rider installation and it will be saved for thirty(30) days in the tools cookie system. From there you can just hit Open Rider and it will open Rider with the S&box solution.

## Note
This tool does not use S&boxs CodeEditor system as it is inaccessible to any kind of addon. Because of this you cannot open specific files in the solution like what the Error List widget does.
